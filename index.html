                            Marvel Studios decided to handle their own creation.</p>

                            Rourke paid for the bird and the gold teeth.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Marvel’s Iron Man 3 showcases one of Marvel Studios’ most complicated action sequences to date. In the film, 13 people fall out of a plane and Iron Man attempts to save them all — even though he can only carry four. With the help
                            of the Red Bull skydiving team, and with rigorous and meticulous planning by second-unit director Brian Smrz and stunt coordinator Jeff Habberstad, 630 jumps over 10 days went off without a hitch.</p>

                            him to take the part and thus gain the freedom to sign on any other role he’d want to after. After that, he had a meeting with the director and the producers who convinced him to take the role.</p>

                            was disappointed that the director refused to even consider him for the part.</p>

                            they turned out to be possibly the blandest villains in MCU history).</p>

                        <p class="card-text">During the making of Thor: Ragnarok, Tessa Thompson suggested confirming Valkyrie’s bisexuality to director Taika Waititi, so they included a scene where a woman is seen leaving Valkyrie’s room. They fought tooth and nail to keep
                            it in the movie, but Marvel excised it, claiming that it slowed down the pacing of the film (although fans are skeptical that a two-second shot could really throw a whole feature film off-kilter).</p>
