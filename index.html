                            Marvel Studios decided to handle their own creation.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Marvel’s Iron Man 3 showcases one of Marvel Studios’ most complicated action sequences to date. In the film, 13 people fall out of a plane and Iron Man attempts to save them all — even though he can only carry four. With the help
                            of the Red Bull skydiving team, and with rigorous and meticulous planning by second-unit director Brian Smrz and stunt coordinator Jeff Habberstad, 630 jumps over 10 days went off without a hitch.</p>

                            him to take the part and thus gain the freedom to sign on any other role he’d want to after. After that, he had a meeting with the director and the producers who convinced him to take the role.</p>
